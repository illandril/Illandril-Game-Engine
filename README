external-resources:
The licenses vary for all of the files under the external-resources directory.
Look for the appropriate "license.txt" or "readme.txt" file to get details for
each file. Feel free to send me an e-mail if you need help.
If you own the copyright to any of these files, and either have a correction to
how I am crediting you or what license they should be using, or want them
removed from this repository, send me an e-mail to let me know. I'll do my best
to make the corrections ASAP.
If you have any resources that you think would be useful to me, and would like
to allow me to distribute them in this repository and use them for testing and
demo games, please let me know.
